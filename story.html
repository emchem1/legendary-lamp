   <h2>our story</h2>
   <f1>
     <div>rahul and emma first met on a fateful day on october 4th 2014 </div>
     <div>(rahul thinks it was october 6th). </div>
     <div>they lived on the same corridor. they would compete to see who could study longer</div>
     <div> in the library but both were often found slumped over a desk, in a deep slumber.</div> 
     <div>over the years, their end of year exam score became a source of </div>
     <div>not-so-friendly competition; with emma coming out on top more often than not.</div>
     <div>in clinical school, as rahul was on his third driving instructor </div>
     <div>and still couldn't make it past gear 3, he had no choice but to brave </div>
     <div>emma's speedy wheels to bedford</div>
     <div>to clarify, they were not together at this point in time</div>
     <div>a few years later, both single and ready to mingle, they reached an agreement </div>
     <div>to get married if they were both still single at 30.</div>
     <div>they are both now 30.</div>
